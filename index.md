<cite>The Art of Playful Escalation</cite> is a book for:

* Young people entering the dating world in the #MeToo era, who want to explore the spectrum of sex & relationships ethically and consensually and also have fun;
* people seeking to have a deeper understanding of what their romantic and sexual relationship lives can be like;
* long-running couples wanting to navigate a relationship transition, whether it's opening up to non-monogamy or decoupling in a healthy manner;

In a overly simplified way, this is the book I wish I could've read as my 16-year old self.
