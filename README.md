## What This Book Is About, And Why You Should Read It

This book is borne out of little games I created to welcome people and bring them into the right mindset as they entered 150-plus person orgies.

If that sentence feels like it suddenly slapped you in the face, it’s because I didn’t ease you into it; I didn't escalate playfully. If I had said _“flirty little games”_, you would’ve known immediately this is a sexual or romantic topic, and if instead of _“right mindset”_ I would’ve said _“a playful, sexy, and consent-driven mindset”_, you would’ve anticipated something even raunchier might follow.

**This is <cite>The Art of Playful Escalation</cite>: knowing when and how to elevate tension in a way that is enjoyable to all parties involved.**

What may have started as an idea from those little games evolved into a collection of essays, perspectives, and personal stories about how love, sex, and relationships are changing in our society—much for the better. People all over are learning kinder ways to communicate; more effective methods for building relationships; and new, more empowering approaches to having sex.

This book will explore and push the boundaries of your understanding of relationships, what identity really is, and the many kinds of intimacy and romance that are available for you to enjoy.
